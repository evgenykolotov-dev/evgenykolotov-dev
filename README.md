### Hello there! 👋  
I'm **Evgeny Kolotov**, a full-time software engineer. In my spare time, I'm dedicated to open-source development, usually spending 1-2 hours in the morning before work on this passion. Most of my upcoming projects here 👇🏻 aim at one core goal - to facilitate learning 📚🤓. These projects will be focused on TypeScript algorithms and preparing for technical interviews 💻🎯.

I'm passionate about writing high-quality, efficient code and constantly seek new ways to enhance my skills and share my knowledge with the community 🌟📈. My primary tech stack includes JavaScript/TypeScript, React, and Node.js 🛠️⚙️. In my portfolio, you'll find a variety of projects ranging from interactive web applications to utilities and libraries 🌐📚.

Additionally, I actively participate in discussions and problem-solving on GitHub, supporting the community and contributing to the open-source movement 🤝💡. Stay tuned for updates on my current projects and achievements! 🚀🎉
